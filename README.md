<h1>Jeu Intelligent</h1>
<p>
  This is a website about a drinking game I used to play with my friends.
  <br>
  You can play at : http://176.181.167.238/JeuIntelligent/accueil 
</p>

<p>
  For now, this is a static website even if I am using javaEE stuff.
  It is because I plan to code some features to play online and it will have to interract with the server.
  Also it is easier for me to deploy (that's definitely not a good reason).
  
  If you want to try on your computer with the same setup as me, you will have to launch <b>src/fr/ji/servlets/Accueil.java</b> on a tomcat server (I use the 9.0, I think you can use a much lower version).
  If you want to use your own setup, you just need few file. 
  All you need is in <b>WebContent</b> folder : 
  <ul>
    <li>WEB-INF/accueil.jsp for "html" content (actually a jsp file but no java code is included (for now)) </li>
    <li>css folder for css files</li>
    <li>js folder for js files </li>
    <li>ressources folder for backround image</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
All suggestions are welcomed !
