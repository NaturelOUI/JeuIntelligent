<h1>Jeu Intelligent</h1>
<p>
  This is a website about a drinking game I used to play with my friend.
  <br>
  You can play at : http://176.181.167.238/JeuIntelligent/accueil 
</p>

<p>
  For now, this is a static website even if I am using javaEE stuff.
  It is because I plan to code some features to play online and it will have to interract with the server.
  Also it is easier for me to deploy (that's definitely not a good reason).
  
  So now, all you need is in <b>WebContent</b> folder : 
  <ul>
    <li>WEB-INF/accueil.jsp for "html" content (actually a jsp file but no java code is included (for now)) </li>
    <li>css folder for css files</li>
    <li>js folder for js files </li>
    <li>ressources folder for backround image</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
All suggestions are welcomed !
